## About this project

This project is about implementing different **Deep Learning Architectures** and **Learning Techniques** on 2 image classification datasets:
- Facial Emotion Recognition Custom Dataset(FER 2013), https://www.kaggle.com/nightfury007/fercustomdataset-3classes
This is a custom version of the original FER dataset consisting of 3 classes: Dissapointed,Interested,Neutral.

- Breast Histopathology Images ,https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/breast-histopathology-images
Dataset consisting of histopathology images from ductal Carcinoma patients divided per patient and per class
